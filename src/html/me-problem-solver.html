            Spraac is a mobile application that assists students in social studies to master their conversation techniques. 
            <br>
            By making practicing accessible through video calling, and providing the students with a semi-realistic roleplaying instructions, their study success is maximized. 
            <br>
            In cooperation with Hanze University's School of Social Studies, I developed Spraac as my bachelor project, with which I was nominated for that year's thesis award.

              IntoReality is a video-editing tool that allows you to add interactive elements to your 360-degree video content. This application was developed in cooperation with Hanze University as an educational tool. 
              <br>
              Adding interactive elements increases the educational value of the video experience while making it more entertaining as well. 
              <br>
              Besides being closely involved in the entire design process, I fulfilled the position of lead software engineer in this project.

            Samenwerkingsspel (Cooperation Game) is an applied game I helped develop during my internship as game developer at 8D Games. 
            <br>
            This game is part of a larger plan to help officials reduce the time needed to grant/deny permits. 
            <br>
            This game focusses on the verbal communication and challenges its players to constuct a well working rocket, that meets their personal demands and the demands of their entire team.
