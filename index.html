                      Being the first person to acquire this combination of degrees, I attempt to combine <strong>User Centered Design</strong> and <strong>Software Engineering</strong> principles to create high quality software that fit the users' needs as well as possible.
                      In my design philosophy, I consider the client to be co-captain together with the development team on their projects, leading us into a direction that complements their needs and is evaluated with our professional experience.

                        Spraac is a mobile application that assists soon-to-be social professionals to practise and master their conversation techniques. 
                        Making practise material accessible to this target group through video calling, and providing students with semi-realistic roleplaying instructions, their study success is maximized.

                        This app was developed in cooperation with Hanze University's School of Social Studies, and was developed as part of my bachelor's project - which was graded with a 9.2 and was nominated for the CMD Thesis Award 2019. Following my bachelor's, I was hired on a freelance basis by the Hanze to further develop this product in the Blackboard environment, one that suited their needs better.

                        Postzegels Please is the game we developed during the Global Game Jam 2021, an 48-hour hackathon-like event during which you completely design and develop a game that fits a theme.
                        Together with four other young-professionals we built this game using Unity3D, and it's source code can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/willem88836/GGJ2021">here</a>.

                        IntoReality is a video-editing tool that allows you to add interactive elements to your 360-degree video content. 
                        This application was developed in cooperation with Hanze University as an educational tool. 
                        Adding interactive elements increases the educational value of the video experience while making it more entertaining as well. 
                        While we were developing this tool, Hanze University was expanding their education to include 360-degree video content for their social studies as a means to prepare them for real-life scenario's.

                      <h4>Samenwerkingsspel</h4>
                      <p>
                        Samenwerkingsspel (Cooperation Game) is an applied game we developed during my internship at 8D Games. 
                        This game is part of a larger project to help officials reduce the time needed to grant/deny permits. 
                        At the time, the speed at which permit requests would be processed was very slow due to the lack of communication between different parties.

                        <br><br>

                        This game focusses on the verbal communication and challenges its players to construct a well working rocket, that meets their own demands and the demands of their entire team.
                        Together with colleagues, I was responsible for the design and development of this program.
