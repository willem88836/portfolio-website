Quick Sort! Everyone likes at least a bit of structure, right? 
<br>
I don't think I have to explain this if you're a CS professional, but Quick Sort is an algorithm that efficiently sorts arrays of data. 
From the array, an element is selected to serve as a pivot. All other elements are compared with this element and swapped to either its left or right side if they are, respectively, smaller or larger.
Then the left and right sides of this pivot are sorted recursively until the entire array is nice and sorted.
<br>
The C# code I wrote for this doesn't really differ too much from that explanation. 
I could, of course, have chosen a different element to serve as a pivot. However, considering the array is filled randomly, there are not many arguments to not pick the first one. 
It's a sorting algorithm. And a relatively efficient one. I like it.
