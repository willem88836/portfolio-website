Conways Game of Life! Simple and yet so elegant.
<br>
The principles of it are quite simple: you've got an A x B size grid in which a cell is either dead or alive (on or off).
Based on each individual cell's circumstances, cells can either be born or deceased every iteration. 
<br>
What I really admire about this algorithm is that it simulates life in its a primal form. Good circumstances create prosperity and bad circumstances poverty. 
Besides it being funny automata to create Glider Guns with, it is also an amazing tool to do basic map or world generation with.
<br>
In the Python code I wrote for this, first the map is filled with random ones and zeroes.
This is followed by iterating t times through this map. Every time applying the GoL's rules. 
To do this, each iteration, a temporary copy is made of the current state that is used as resource for the new iteration.
