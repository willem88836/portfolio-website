Kruskal's Algorithm! A holistic approach to Spanning Trees!
<br>
To be honest, I primarily chose this algorithm because of its name and because I didn't know it yet. Turns out it was interesting too!
It's an algorithm that builds a minimum-spanning-tree in, what I think, an intriguing manner. 
By picking the cheapest possible edge in the entire graph, instead of one that's connected to the spanning-tree already, as Prim does.
If it connects two different trees, it is added to the solution. 
<br>
In my Java implementation, I use a completely connected graph, where each edge is given a random weight. 
I chose to track each different tree in an integer array, as this is far more manageable than an overcomplicated reference list (which might be faster).
Although this algorithm is probably not the best way to create a minimum-spanning-tree, I do find it a very interesting approach, as it looks to the graph as a whole, rather than a subset of it. Almost metaphorical.
