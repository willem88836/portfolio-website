Hi! I am Willem, an optimistic and widely interested software engineer. 
I am always looking for ways to implement new innovations in complicated projects for the better of the community and businesses.
<br>
In advance, thanks for looking at my resume, and I hope we can sit down for a cup of coffee some time!


Spraac is a mobile <b>application</b> that assists students in social studies to master their <b>conversation techniques</b>. 
<br>
By making practicing accessible through <b>video calling</b>, and providing the students with a semi-realistic <b>roleplaying</b> instructions, their study success is maximized. 
<br>
In cooperation with <b>Hanze University's School of Social Studies</b>, I developed Spraac as my bachelor project, with which I was nominated for that year's <b>thesis award</b>. 


IntoReality is a <b>video-editing tool</b> that allows you to add <b>interactive elements</b> to your <b>360-degree video</b> content. This application was developed in cooperation with <b>Hanze University</b> as an educational tool. 
<br>
Adding interactive elements <b>increases the educational value</b> of the video experience while making it more <b>entertaining</b> as well. 
<br>
Besides being closely involved in the entire <b>design</b> process, I fulfilled the position of <b>lead software engineer</b> in this project. 


Samenwerkingsspel (Cooperation Game) is an <b>applied game</b> we developed during my internship as game developer at <b>8D Games</b>. 
<br>
This game is part of a larger plan to help officials <b>reduce the time needed to grant/deny permits</b>. 
<br>
This game focusses on the <b>verbal communication</b> and challenges its players to <b>constuct a well working rocket</b>, that meets their personal demands and the demands of their entire team.
