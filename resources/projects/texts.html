Hi! I am Willem, an optimistic and widely interested software engineer. 
I am always looking for ways to implement new innovations in complicated projects for the better of the community and businesses.
<br>
In advance, thanks for looking at my resume, and I hope we can sit down for a cup of coffee some time!


Spraac is a mobile application that assists students in social studies to master their conversation techniques. 
<br>
By making practicing accessible through video calling, and providing the students with a semi-realistic roleplaying instructions, their study success is maximized. 
<br>
In cooperation with Hanze University's School of Social Studies, I developed Spraac as my bachelor project, with which I was nominated for that year's thesis award. 


IntoReality is a video-editing tool that allows you to add interactive elements to your 360-degree video content. This application was developed in cooperation with Hanze University as an educational tool. 
<br>
Adding interactive elements increases the educational value of the video experience while making it more entertaining as well. 
<br>
Besides being closely involved in the entire design process, I fulfilled the position of lead software engineer in this project. 


Samenwerkingsspel (Cooperation Game) is an applied game I helped develop during my internship as game developer at 8D Games. 
<br>
This game is part of a larger plan to help officials reduce the time needed to grant/deny permits. 
<br>
This game focusses on the verbal communication and challenges its players to constuct a well working rocket, that meets their personal demands and the demands of their entire team.
