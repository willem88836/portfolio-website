Samenwerkingsspel (Cooperation Game) is an <b>applied game</b> we developed during my internship as game developer at <b>8D Games</b>. 
<br>
This game is part of a larger plan to help officials <b>reduce the time needed to grant/deny permits</b>. 
<br>
This game focusses on the <b>verbal communication</b> and challenges its players to <b>construct a well working rocket</b>, that meets their personal demands and the demands of their entire team.
