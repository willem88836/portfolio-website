Spraac is a mobile <b>application</b> that assists students in social studies to master their <b>conversation techniques</b>. 
<br>
By making practising accessible through <b>video calling</b>, and providing the students with semi-realistic <b>roleplaying</b> instructions, their study success is maximized. 
<br>
In cooperation with <b>Hanze University's School of Social Studies</b>, I developed Spraac as my bachelor project, with which I was nominated for that year's <b>thesis award</b>.
