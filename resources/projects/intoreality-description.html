IntoReality is a <b>video-editing tool</b> that allows you to add <b>interactive elements</b> to your <b>360-degree video</b> content. This application was developed in cooperation with <b>Hanze University</b> as an educational tool. 
<br>
Adding interactive elements <b>increases the educational value</b> of the video experience while making it more <b>entertaining</b> as well. 
<br>
Besides being closely involved in the entire <b>design</b> process, I fulfilled the position of <b>lead software engineer</b> in this project.
